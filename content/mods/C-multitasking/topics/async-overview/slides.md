Today, we're focusing on concurrency: _asynchronous programming_

# What's async?

- Concurrent programming model
- Very suitable for running a large number of I/O bound tasks
  - like web servers!
- Look and feel* of synchronous code through `async`/`await` syntax

**Well, not perfectly. We'll get to that*

# From sync to async

```rust
use std::net::UdpSocket;

// <nothing>
fn main() -> std::io::Result<()> {
    let socket = UdpSocket::bind("127.0.0.1:34254")?;

    let mut buf = [0; 10];
    let (bytes_read, src) = socket.recv_from(&mut buf)?;

    let buf = &mut buf[..bytes_read];
    buf.reverse();
    socket.send_to(buf, &src)?;

    Ok(())
}

# From sync to async

```rust
use tokio::net::UdpSocket;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> std::io::Result<()> {

*Question: What stands out to you?*

# Async in Rust

- Revolve around `Future` trait (~like JS `Promise`, C# `Task`)  
  &rarr; `async fn`s return `Future`s

- `Future`s are inert
- `async` is zero-cost
- No built-in runtime
- Single- or multithreaded execution
- Can be mixed with other concurrency models
- Relatively new and lacks some features and nice diagnostics

# State of the `async` art
What you can expect doing `async` Rust

- Blazingly fast applications
- More interaction with advanced language features
- Compatibility issues (re: colored functions)
- Faster evolving ecosystem
- `async fn` in traits stable since Rust 1.75

*But still a work in progress*

# Support of `async`

- Fundamental types and traits are in `std`
- `async`/`await` are native to the language
- Utilities/extensions in `futures` crate
- Async runtimes are third party

Example runtimes: `async-std`, `tokio`, `smol`
